<p>An open-source, free PDF creation library written in TypeScript. It allows for declarative PDF creation using templates and works both on servers and browsers.</p>
<p>Since its beta release in February 2022, it has reached Version 3 by November 2023. On <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, it has garnered 1500 stars, and on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pdfme/generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npm</a>, it sees about 10,000 downloads weekly, though there's some variation.</p>
<p>It's already integrated into various services worldwide, including electronic medical record creation, factory procedure manual production, and e-commerce custom packaging.</p>
<p>This article aims to explain the motivation behind developing pdfme.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-develop-a-pdf-library">Why Develop a <strong>PDF Library</strong>?<a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/why-develop-pdf-library-now#why-develop-a-pdf-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-develop-a-pdf-library" title="Direct link to why-develop-a-pdf-library">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Since 2014, <a href="https://github.com/foliojs/pdfkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pdfkit</a>, a fantastic library for creating and editing PDF files, has been available. Another library, <a href="https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pdf-lib</a>, written in TypeScript and offering additional functionalities over pdfkit's PDF creation capabilities, emerged in 2018.</p>
<p>Both are open-source, free, and available under the MIT License.
So, why develop pdfme despite these excellent libraries?</p>
<p>It started as a simple function with no significant motivation, but it evolved into a passion to "<strong>eliminate the tedious task of PDF creation from the world!</strong>" This drive emerged through the following three steps:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-created-a-function-to-return-pdfs-from-json-input-2020">1. Created a Function to Return PDFs from JSON Input, 2020~<a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/why-develop-pdf-library-now#1-created-a-function-to-return-pdfs-from-json-input-2020" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1.

<ul>
<li>pdfkit and pdf-lib are great but require imperative coding and struggle with scaling template numbers.</li>
<li>For a personal development project, I created a function to return PDFs from JSON input, which led to the precursor of pdfme, <a href="https://github.com/hand-dot/labelmake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">labelmake</a>.</li>
<li>It seemed convenient, so I published it on npm.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A colleague was struggling with creating something like a notice of work conditions using <a href="https://www.jaspersoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaspersoft</a>, which seemed overly complex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existing solutions were either too complicated for our needs or required expensive licenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added an easy-to-use WYSIWYG, similar to PowerPoint, and rebranded labelmake to pdfme, releasing it as a beta version.</p>

<ul>
<li>Recognized the inherent problems in PDF creation. Why does it have to be so cumbersome?</li>
<li>Contemplated why PDF creation remains a tedious task without modern solutions.</li>
<li>Aimed to contribute to the community at the next level, similar to how pdfkit and pdf-lib did.</li>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementing-sufficiently-necessary-features">Implementing Sufficiently Necessary Features<a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/why-develop-pdf-library-now#implementing-sufficiently-necessary-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementing Sufficiently Necessary Features" title="Direct link to Implementing Sufficiently Necessary Features">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Focusing on simplicity while providing sufficiently necessary features.
In Version 3, we released plugins and custom themes/labels, emphasizing "customizability."</p>
<p>Being Japanese, I ensured our product could easily handle <a href="https://pdfme.com/docs/custom-fonts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom CJK fonts</a>, unlike others focused only on Latin characters. Interestingly, China is where we get the most website traffic.</p>
<p>However, we're not yet sufficiently equipped for common use cases like dynamically changing table heights. We plan to support relative coordinate layouts and dynamic tables in <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pdfme/projects/8/views/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Version 4</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-source-and-community">Open Source and Community<a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/why-develop-pdf-library-now#open-source-and-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open Source and Community" title="Direct link to Open Source and Community">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Our current motivation is to contribute to the community at the next level, as pdfkit and pdf-lib have done.</p>
<p>I mainly develop the software, but thankfully, 2-3 people contribute daily.</p>
<p>Bug reports and feature proposals can be made through <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Issues</a>, and we also have an open <a href="https://discord.gg/xWPTJbmgNV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> channel. Any clear questions in these open forums usually receive a response within a day or two, including from me.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="free-to-use">Free to Use<a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/why-develop-pdf-library-now#free-to-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Free to Use" title="Direct link to Free to Use">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Currently, there's no direct monetization from the library.
It can be installed via npm install and used for commercial purposes without worry.</p>
<p>However, development takes time, so I need to earn a living. I'm working full-time and plan to continue this as a side project for the next few years.</p>
<p>Additionally, I operate a service in Japan using pdfme, <a href="https://labelmake.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">labelmake.jp</a>, and occasionally monetize through technical support inquiries.</p>
<p>Support (including documentation) is where I believe users have the most need, so I plan to</p>
<p>establish a more reliable system in the future if necessary.</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating a future where PDF creation is quick and cost-free.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>We're making it so one day we'll say, 'Remember how hard it used to be to create PDFs? What was that all about?'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Believe that even less modern areas can evolve through community contributions.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Never thought a function I created years ago would now be used worldwide.</li>
<li>OSS is fascinating and engaging! I hope to write another interesting chapter.</li>
</ul>
