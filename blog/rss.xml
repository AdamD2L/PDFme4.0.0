            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-dynamic-tables-couldnt-be-implemented-in-pdfme">Why Dynamic Tables Couldn't Be Implemented in pdfme<a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/implementation-Ideas-for-dynamic-tables#why-dynamic-tables-couldnt-be-implemented-in-pdfme" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Dynamic Tables Couldn't Be Implemented in pdfme" title="Direct link to Why Dynamic Tables Couldn't Be Implemented in pdfme">​</a></h2>
<p>Until now, pdfme has been realizing simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_data_printing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">variable data printing</a> by embedding PDF data into a property called <code>basePdf</code> in the template and overlaying a <code>schema</code> on top of this PDF.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/b7b9c0b7611e-20240102.png" alt="Image of the pdfme process" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This method is incredibly simple and allows for the easy creation of customized PDFs.</p>
<p>However, there is a significant need that cannot be ignored for certain use cases in PDF creation.<br>
<!-- -->That need is table rendering. More specifically, many users want to address cases where the number of rows, like in the red-framed section of the image below, increases, such as in invoices.</p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/53a9a0a584fc-20240102.png" width="500px">
<p>The method of overlaying a schema on the basePdf, as explained above, doesn't allow for an efficient implementation of page breaks.</p>
<p>Therefore, the current version of pdfme cannot support tables where rows dynamically increase.</p>
<p>I understand this need but was struggling with how exactly to implement it.<br>
<!-- -->This has been the main blocker in implementing Tables.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-implement-page-breaks">How to Implement Page Breaks<a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/implementation-Ideas-for-dynamic-tables#how-to-implement-page-breaks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Implement Page Breaks" title="Direct link to How to Implement Page Breaks">​</a></h2>
<p>I've been <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/discussions/148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussing</a> this with users for quite some time, and finally, there seems to be a way to implement page breaks. Two key elements have come together:</p>
<ul>
<li>ReadOnly Schemas added in <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/releases/tag/3.2.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V3.2.0</a>
<ul>
<li>Line, Rectangle, Ellipse, SVG, Text, Image</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A new way to specify basePdf and padding implemented for <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/pull/394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V4</a>, called <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/blob/c4dfa7023a42d9ab207784a6557f902c078bdcd6/packages/common/src/schema.ts#L87" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlankPDF</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With ReadOnly Schemas, it's possible to design the static parts of a template within pdfme without loading a PDF designed in basePdf. This allows for the addition of the height of schemas added to the page, adjusting the y-coordinate of all schemas below it by the increased height. Padding also allows control over where to resume rendering after a page break.</p>
<p>The following figure shows an example where 19 rows of table data are provided, causing a page break, and the 'note' schema being pushed down.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Example of table with page break" src="https://pdfme.com/assets/images/dynamictable-2bb810fcf2dd2086c5951ed2ee4442cb.png" width="4705" height="3766" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The logic I had in mind was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Render the table one row at a time, from Header to Row19.</li>
<li>As the height increases and spills over the first page at Row 12, a page break occurs, creating a second page.</li>
<li>After rendering up to Row19, the generator function returns the final height of the table, which is retained in a variable like yAdjust (190mm in the figure above).</li>
<li>For all schemas below the increased height schema (in this example, 'note'), add the increased height (190mm) to their y-coordinate. The rendering starts on the second page at a y-coordinate of 140mm.</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue is that it doesn't accommodate fixed layouts like headers or footers. In that case, instead of specifying the size of <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/blob/c4dfa7023a42d9ab207784a6557f902c078bdcd6/packages/common/src/schema.ts#L87" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlankPDF</a>'s width and height, specify a PDF containing the fixed design of the header or footer. This is planned for further modification.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-tackle-the-complexity-of-table-settings-and-rendering">How to Tackle the Complexity of Table Settings and Rendering<a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/implementation-Ideas-for-dynamic-tables#how-to-tackle-the-complexity-of-table-settings-and-rendering" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Tackle the Complexity of Table Settings and Rendering" title="Direct link to How to Tackle the Complexity of Table Settings and Rendering">​</a></h2>
<p>Table settings and rendering can get complex. How should we approach it?<br>
<!-- -->I want to leverage the simplicity of pdfme, which allows for easy PDF creation, to implement the table functionality.</p>
<p>For example, consider how to set up the following table.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/5607ddfc06c7-20240102.png" alt="Example of a complex table" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>A table is essentially composed of headers (th) and table data (td).<br>
<!-- -->Table data may be rendered in something other than text. In this example, <code>Name</code> and <code>Category</code> columns are rendered with a Text renderer, while <code>Image</code> column is rendered with an Image renderer.</p>
<p><strong>Fortunately, pdfme already implements various renderers like Text, Image, SVG, Barcodes, etc. Therefore, there's no need to create new rendering processes for each cell; once the size and position of a cell are determined, existing PDF rendering processes can be used.</strong></p>
<p>This leverages the plugin architecture of pdfme's rendering processes, potentially simplifying complex tasks.</p>
<p>This idea came from an <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues/332#issuecomment-1872032370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interesting comment</a> left by <a href="https://github.com/MP70" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MP70</a> on the dynamic table issue.<br>
<!-- -->Considering the above, I believe the table should do the following three things:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-table-styling">1. Table Styling<a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/implementation-Ideas-for-dynamic-tables#1-table-styling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Table Styling" title="Direct link to 1. Table Styling">​</a></h3>
<p>The following image shows a QR code setting panel, but similar style settings should be possible for tables as well.</p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/9444827add81-20240102.png" width="500px">

<li>horizontal, vertical</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cell Background Color<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Plan to implement a stripe design, alternating odd and even rows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Header Visibility</li>
</ul>

Setting Headers and Columns" title="Direct link to 2. Setting Headers and Columns">​</a></h3>
<p>Add columns to the header and set how they will be rendered.</p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/560ebea7ca2e-20240102.png" width="500px">
<ul>
<li>Each column is rendered with <code>ReadOnlyText</code>
<ul>
<li>Options available in the existing Text renderer like text color and background color can be used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Specify Type to set up rendering of table data<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Use renderers available in pdfme like Image, Barcodes, etc., as types</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clicking the gear icon in the image above opens a modal to set the Column and Type</li>
</ul>

Calculating Table Layout" title="Direct link to 3. Calculating Table Layout">​</a></h3>
<p>Once the style and column rendering settings are determined, calculate the layout and render the cells.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculating and rendering cell positions<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Generally, render at the same x-coordinate as each column, but use the y-coordinate and height of the row above for the y-coordinate. Once the position is set, render the cell using the column settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calculating the height of Rows and Cells<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>As explained in the page break section, the increased height needs to be communicated to the generator function.</li>
<li>As a current issue, the Text renderer, if not using the Dynamic Font Size feature, might render beyond the set height, as shown in the image below.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/2f880c86b4fd-20240102.png" alt="Text rendering spilling over set height" class="img_ev3q"></li>
<li>Ideally, the row height should be expanded, as shown in the image below. To achieve this, the Text renderer needs to return the rendered height after rendering.<!-- -->
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/zenn-user-upload/3b7065ee2f39-20240102.png" width="500px">
</li>
<li>The height of each cell's rendering result determines the height of each Row, and the total height of all Rows determines the height of the table.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>An open-source, free PDF creation library written in TypeScript. It allows for declarative PDF creation using templates and works both on servers and browsers.</p>
<p>Since its beta release in February 2022, it has reached Version 3 by November 2023. On <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, it has garnered 1500 stars, and on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pdfme/generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npm</a>, it sees about 10,000 downloads weekly, though there's some variation.</p>
<p>It's already integrated into various services worldwide, including electronic medical record creation, factory procedure manual production, and e-commerce custom packaging.</p>
<p>This article aims to explain the motivation behind developing pdfme.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-develop-a-pdf-library">Why Develop a <strong>PDF Library</strong>?<a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/why-develop-pdf-library-now#why-develop-a-pdf-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-develop-a-pdf-library" title="Direct link to why-develop-a-pdf-library">​</a></h2>
<p>Since 2014, <a href="https://github.com/foliojs/pdfkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pdfkit</a>, a fantastic library for creating and editing PDF files, has been available. Another library, <a href="https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pdf-lib</a>, written in TypeScript and offering additional functionalities over pdfkit's PDF creation capabilities, emerged in 2018.</p>
<p>Both are open-source, free, and available under the MIT License.
So, why develop pdfme despite these excellent libraries?</p>
<p>It started as a simple function with no significant motivation, but it evolved into a passion to "<strong>eliminate the tedious task of PDF creation from the world!</strong>" This drive emerged through the following three steps:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-created-a-function-to-return-pdfs-from-json-input-2020">1. Created a Function to Return PDFs from JSON Input, 2020~<a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/why-develop-pdf-library-now#1-created-a-function-to-return-pdfs-from-json-input-2020" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Created a Function to Return PDFs from JSON Input, 2020~" title="Direct link to 1. Created a Function to Return PDFs from JSON Input, 2020~">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>pdfkit and pdf-lib are great but require imperative coding and struggle with scaling template numbers.</li>
<li>For a personal development project, I created a function to return PDFs from JSON input, which led to the precursor of pdfme, <a href="https://github.com/hand-dot/labelmake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">labelmake</a>.</li>
<li>It seemed convenient, so I published it on npm.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A colleague was struggling with creating something like a notice of work conditions using <a href="https://www.jaspersoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaspersoft</a>, which seemed overly complex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existing solutions were either too complicated for our needs or required expensive licenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added an easy-to-use WYSIWYG, similar to PowerPoint, and rebranded labelmake to pdfme, releasing it as a beta version.</p>

<p>Focusing on simplicity while providing sufficiently necessary features.
In Version 3, we released plugins and custom themes/labels, emphasizing "customizability."</p>
<p>Being Japanese, I ensured our product could easily handle <a href="https://pdfme.com/docs/custom-fonts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom CJK fonts</a>, unlike others focused only on Latin characters. Interestingly, China is where we get the most website traffic.</p>
<p>However, we're not yet sufficiently equipped for common use cases like dynamically changing table heights. We plan to support relative coordinate layouts and dynamic tables in <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pdfme/projects/8/views/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Version 4</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-source-and-community">Open Source and Community<a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/why-develop-pdf-library-now#open-source-and-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open Source and Community" title="Direct link to Open Source and Community">​</a></h3>
<p>Our current motivation is to contribute to the community at the next level, as pdfkit and pdf-lib have done.</p>
<p>I mainly develop the software, but thankfully, 2-3 people contribute daily.</p>
<p>Bug reports and feature proposals can be made through <a href="https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Issues</a>, and we also have an open <a href="https://discord.gg/xWPTJbmgNV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> channel. Any clear questions in these open forums usually receive a response within a day or two, including from me.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="free-to-use">Free to Use<a href="https://pdfme.com/blog/why-develop-pdf-library-now#free-to-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Free to Use" title="Direct link to Free to Use">​</a></h3>
<p>Currently, there's no direct monetization from the library.
It can be installed via npm install and used for commercial purposes without worry.</p>
<p>However, development takes time, so I need to earn a living. I'm working full-time and plan to continue this as a side project for the next few years.</p>
<p>Additionally, I operate a service in Japan using pdfme, <a href="https://labelmake.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">labelmake.jp</a>, and occasionally monetize through technical support inquiries.</p>
<p>Support (including documentation) is where I believe users have the most need, so I plan to</p>
<p>establish a more reliable system in the future if necessary.</p>
